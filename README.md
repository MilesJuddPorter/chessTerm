## What is FEN?
"FEN is the abbreviation of Forsyth-Edwards Notation, and it is the standard notation to describe positions of a chess game. Steven J. Edwards, a computer programmer, created this notation system based on another system designed by the journalist David Forsyth. Edwards modified the older notation system so that chess software could use it." <br>

## Other Information
I just made this as my first ever go project to learn, feel free to do anything with it. <br>
I might look to add lichess puzzles to this (from their open sourced collection) so you can do lichess puzzles from the terminal
